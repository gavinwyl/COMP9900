This is my diary for COMP9900, and I will update it at leat once a week. It will focus on what I did and some ideas during the past week. Hope my teammates and I can fulfill this project successfully and smoothly.

Week 1:
I formed a group with 3 teammates and had our first online meeting, as We are not all in Sydney right now due to the travel ban. On 16 Sept, we discussed all the projects and decided to implement the Online Property Sales. Moreover, we also discuss the job responsibilities for everyone roughly: me for front-end part, Yixiao for back-end part, Shuang leading the project as scrum manager, while Wenhao implement both parts of front-end and back-end.
For week 1, we plan to finish the first draft of the proposal. I finish the users stories and define sprints with Yixiao.
